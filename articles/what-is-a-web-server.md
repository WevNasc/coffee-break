The web server is an application that can deliver web content like HTML, images, JSON, etc... The web servers use the HTTP protocol to deliver the content which can be static or dinamic. 

> Basically, static content never changes by the web server, this is only delivered by them. And dinamic content may be generated by the web server, and it is delived by them as well.

The web server common uses are hosting pages on the web or creating APIs, but also it is useful as a *proxy* or a *load balance*. To serve the content, the web server needs to run in a host and a port, for example, `http://localhost:8080`, in this case, the host is `localhost` and the port is `8080`.

The communication between the client and server happens through the HTTP protocol, basically, the client does a HTTP request using a URL and HTTP method.

For example: when you type in the browser `www.myblog.com/index.html`, what happens is, the browser does a HTTP request using the method `GET`, the server handles it, process it and respond it with the HTML content.

## How does the web server work?

I will give a basic example of a blocking single thread web server:

When the request comes in the web server, it creates a *TCP socket* in a queue. For each *TCP socket* the web server allocates a bit of memory, so, the more request you make, the more memory will be used.

> TCP socket represents a connection between the client and the server, embedded with host, content, and port data.

The requests are processed one at a time in a single thread, following the order that comes in the server. As soon as, the request is processed, the socket is closed and the memory is released.

Today there is a bunch of web servers that you may use to serve content like, **Nginx**, **apache2**, **tomcat**, and of course, you can do one by yourself, using, for example, **node js**, **Clojure** among others.
