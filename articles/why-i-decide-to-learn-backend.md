title: "Why I decided to learn backend"

When my career in software development started, the first step was like backend developer. At that time we didn't have sophisticated systems like we have today, everything was very simple and all systems basically ran in one or two machines, essentially the service make a request and receive a response just as HTML page, and everything seemed like a *CRUD*.

The mobile development started with many problems to solve, like, managing many threads, creating optimized code for machine (smartphone) with poor performance, poor connection, and low storage, and all of them seemed much more attractive.

I started to develop mobile application due to an opportunity that I received some time ago, and I started to improve my skills for this. Thanks to that, I had an opportunity to learn many things about OOP, design patterns, and software architecture, once most mobile platforms and applications are based on them.

## The change

In the last year, I started thinking about changing my career again and the main cause was because the mobile development stopped being a challenge to me. The changes I used to see before, started being easy to solve, because there are many tools and I have got knowledge to solve them now. Besides, the challenges are now the same in most projects, like making a request, getting the response, and creating a beautiful screen.

That has been a big change for me. Now I am learning many things and developing other skills that I didn't need for mobile development, which includes new tools, programming language, system design and the most important one is, to work with different people. Now that I feel closer to the product, I need to understand much more the way everything works.

What I mean in this text is: If you feel comfortable in not seeing challenges anymore with what you are working, take a time and think about it, maybe it is time to change and start learning new things. Maybe that can be the only way to continue growing as a professional and as a person.

## Some pieces of advice

### Talk to people about that
Talk to someone who cares about your career, there should be one at your company or in the community you are part. These people can have a different view on the situation and could indicate to you what the best time to change is.

Try to look for people that are already working in the area you would like to move on. It is very useful to understand the way things work there and what the best approach to hit your target is.

### Try by yourself
If you want to move on, you are likely to have done it already, but if you haven't, try to do something by yourself, in my case, I had an opportunity to work in some projects making the backend with a more experient person, it was very useful in the beginning to confirm my feelings.

Create personal projects is also a good approach to experience these new things and you can do it without pressure.

### Learn basic things before
It can be obvious, but learn basic things, make sure that you know how they work. In the backend, for example, you should know how to create endpoints, manipulate databases, create the environments, and also be used to the language you would like to work with. Try to keep learning, make a plan to learn one thing a week or a month.

### Change at once
It is very hard in the developing world to work in two different contexts at the same time, it can be very stressful, and demotivated over the time, so when the time comes, change at once.
